  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hi, I’m a 39-year-old husband, father of three awesome kids (ages 19, 16, and 13), and a proud career-changer currently pursuing a future in dentistry. After stepping away from a previous career, I made the decision to follow a new path—one that’s challenging, meaningful, and deeply rewarding.

When I’m not studying or working toward that goal, you’ll usually find me outdoors—hiking, fishing, camping, or snowboarding with my family. I’m passionate about nature, staying active, and spending time with the people I love most, especially my incredible wife, who supports me every step of the way. Life’s an adventure, and I’m excited about where this one is headed.</p>
